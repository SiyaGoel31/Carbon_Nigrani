## 📖 Project Overview  

Coal is a backbone of India’s energy system, but also a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. While carbon neutrality is a global goal, **India’s coal sector lacks integrated tools** for emission monitoring and strategy planning.  

**Carbon Nigrani** bridges this gap by:  

1. **Tracking Emissions** – Calculates carbon emissions using real emission factor datasets.  
2. **Gap Analysis** – Identifies deviations between current emissions and target thresholds.  
3. **Actionable Strategies** – Suggests ways to reduce emissions, optimize processes, and adopt greener practices.  
4. **Carbon Neutrality Roadmap** – Provides **short-term and long-term pathways** for mines to achieve neutrality.  
5. **Market Integration** – Creates scope for **carbon credit trading** to incentivize sustainability.  

The project focuses on **real impact**—helping India’s coal sector transition towards a **sustainable future**.
